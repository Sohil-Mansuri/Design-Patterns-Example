we want to implement one dialog box 

it has three controlls i) Artical Listbox ii) Text box to show selected Artical iii) Save button to store in DB

Requirements: 

when Artical is selected it should be visible in Text box 

if Text box is not empty then only Save button should be active else it should be disabled 

when we click on Save button then selected artical should be save in DB

if somebody clear textbox then save button should get disabled 


so using mediator pattern we can achieve this 

i have also used Observer pattern, because using mediator pattern 
if our logic become more complex then we need to add more if and else statements

please check both the approaches
