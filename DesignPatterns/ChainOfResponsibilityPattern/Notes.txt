Lets implement Webserver pipeline

in webserver pipeline all operation happens in order 

Like

1. Authetication

2. Logging

3. Token generated

4. Request mapping 


if any on of the fail then it just stop from there and return error to client 

Lets implement ... check in Problem section 

as you can see there are multiple issue with that implementation

one is its not follwing OCP, if there is any new Middleware added then again we have to update existing code 

second is in this implementation order is fixed but in future we have to update this order then again we have to make changes 
here 

above issues can be solved using Chain of Responsibilities Design pattern
